Selection panel
The selection panel for the 2013 All-Australian team consisted of chairman Andrew Demetriou, Mark Evans, Kevin Bartlett, Luke Darcy, Danny Frawley, Glen Jakovich, Mark Ricciuto and Cameron Ling.


Team


Initial squad
At the conclusion of the 2013 AFL home and away season, a provisional squad of 40 players was chosen. The most controversial omissions were Tom Liberatore, who led the league for clearances, Steve Johnson and Pearce Hanley, as well as no selections from finalists Richmond or Carlton. 25 players in the squad had not previously been selected in an All-Australian team.


Final team
Geelong had the most selections, with four players. Geelong captain Joel Selwood was announced as the All-Australian captain and Gold Coast star Gary Ablett Jr. was announced as vice-captain.

Note: the position of coach in the All-Australian team is traditionally awarded to the coach of the premiership team.
