# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scientific Discourse

This project prioritizes scientific rigor and evidence-based decision-making:

- **Evidence Over Opinion:** Technical decisions should be supported by empirical data, citations, or reproducible experiments
- **Respectful Disagreement:** Disagreements are expected and welcome, but must remain professional and constructive
- **Peer Review Mindset:** Critiques should focus on ideas and implementations, not individuals
- **Reproducibility:** Claims about performance or security must be reproducible with documented methods

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.
