Bathers Surprised is an 1853 nude oil painting by the Irish artist William Mulready. It depicts a group of naked young women surprised while bathing in a stream. The foreground figure is inspired by the Italian Old Master's Titian's Venus Anadyomene.
Mulready had earned his reputation during the Regency era for genre paintings depicting scenes of everyday life. This painting was exhibited at the Salon of 1855 in Paris, the Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857 in Manchester and the International Exhibition of 1862 in London. Today the work is in the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin, having been acquired in 1911.
