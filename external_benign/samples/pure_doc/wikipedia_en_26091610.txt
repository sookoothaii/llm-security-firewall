Journalism

He then worked as a Sports Sub-editor with the Evening Echo before working for a year as a sports reporter with The Mayo News, sports editor of fledgling publication The Athlone Voice from September 2003 until 2006, then deputy sports editor with the fledgling Irish Daily Mail before applying for the RTÉ job. Mullin began working for the RTÉ News Sports Unit in October 2006.
He received the ESB National Media Award for Provincial/Regional Sport Print in 2004 for covering Westmeath's first Leinster Senior Football Championship title win.
In February 2010, he announced his departure from RTÉ to become the Irish Racing Post's editor. He took up the role in March 2010.
