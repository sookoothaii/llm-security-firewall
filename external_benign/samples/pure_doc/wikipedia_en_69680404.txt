History
Judd Books was originally founded within premises on Judd Street, London - hence its name. It opened a new shop on Marchmont Street, London and for a time operated two stores. Eventually the Judd Street store closed and their sole premises remains on Marchmont Street to this day.
In 2008, the Guardian outlined Judd Books as one of "London's finest bookshops".
