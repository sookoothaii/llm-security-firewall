The 2024 IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge season was the second season of the IMSA VP Racing SportsCar Challenge after being established in 2023 as a replacement for the IMSA Prototype Challenge. The season began on January 20 at Daytona International Speedway and concluded on October 19 at Road Atlanta. After IMSA's removal of the LMP3 class from the 2024 IMSA SportsCar Championship, this series is now the highest tier of racing for LMP3s in the United States.


Calendar
The provisional schedule was released on August 4, 2023, at IMSA's annual State of the Sport Address, featuring twelve rounds split across six race weekends. Five of the six events had confirmed dates.
