The fort was probably constructed during the Dutch Formosa and Spanish Formosa period. It was once occupied by the French Third Republic army during the Sino-French War. The Japanese government remodeled the fort to become as what it is today. In September 2016, the Keelung City Government announced a plan to restore and preserve the fort under the subsidy of the Ministry of Culture.
