Austinia is a ghost town in Galveston County, Texas, United States.
Is it situated on the Bolivar Peninsula. On May 24, 1838, the Congress of the Republic of Texas chartered the Brazos and Galveston Railroad Company to build a railway from the community to Bolivar Peninsula; the project went unfinished. The town's area was owned by Stephen F. Austin until his death, then Emily Austin Perry—the sole heir of Stephen—deeded the land to her son and pioneer George L. Hammeken. Hammeken and James Franklin Perry—Emily's husband—sold shares of the land, and on February 1, 1839, bought the peninsula outright through a company they established. Despite having investors funding the railway construction, the company started on a canal. The investors left, and besides Guy M. Bryan living on a ranch there until 1871, the area has been abandoned since.
