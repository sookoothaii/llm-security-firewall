Description
Frasera neglecta is a perennial herb producing one or more erect stems from a rosetted base, reaching up to roughly half a meter tall. The leaves are linear or lance-shaped and green with white margins; the largest leaves at the base of the plant can reach 20 centimeters in length.
The inflorescence is a dense panicle atop the stem, sometimes interrupted into a series of clusters of flowers. Each flower has a calyx of four pointed sepals and a corolla of four pointed lobes each up to 1.5 centimeters long. The corolla is greenish white with purple streaks. There are four stamens tipped with large anthers and a central ovary.
