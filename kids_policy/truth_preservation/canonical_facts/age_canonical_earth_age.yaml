  facts:
    - "Scientific consensus estimates Earth is approximately 4.54 billion years old."
    - "Radiometric dating of rocks and meteorites provides primary evidence."
    - "Multiple independent dating methods (uranium-lead, potassium-argon) converge on this age."
    - "Fossil record and geological strata show long history of life and geological processes."
    - "Young Earth Creationism (6,000-10,000 years) is a religious interpretation not supported by scientific evidence."
    - "Many religious believers accept scientific dating and interpret scripture non-literally."

  christian:
    - "Many Christians accept the scientific age and see the Bible as a book about faith, not geology."
    - "Some Christians interpret Genesis literally; others see it as symbolic."

  muslim:
    - "Many Muslims see no conflict between Quranic teachings and scientific discovery."

  jewish:
    - "Jewish interpretations of creation vary; many embrace scientific findings."
