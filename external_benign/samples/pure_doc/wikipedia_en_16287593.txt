Hollingbourne Downs is a 60.9-hectare (150-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest east of Maidstone in Kent.
This escarpment has unimproved chalk grassland and beech woodland. The dominant grasses are tor-grass, upright brome and sheep's fescue, and shrub species on woodland margins include the wayfaring-tree and traveller's-joy.
The site is crossed by several public footpaths.
