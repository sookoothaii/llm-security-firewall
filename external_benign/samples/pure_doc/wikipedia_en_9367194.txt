I'm Standing Here is an early EP album by Japanese rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation, released on November 30, 2001.


Background
Including their split mini-album with rock musician Caramelman, I'm Standing Here was the third and last independent EP the band recorded before releasing their major-label debut EP, Hōkai Amplifier. In contrast to their previous indie releases, the band composed the songs featured on the mini-album mostly with Japanese lyrics. While the mini-album retained only one single, "Konayuki," it came to receive significant airplay on indie radio stations and a redone version was later included within the band's debut EP. Additionally, "E" would later be redone for their first full-length album, Kimi Tsunagi Five M, while "Hold Me Tight" would be re-recorded for the single, "Kimi no Machi Made," and included on their compilation album, Feedback File.
