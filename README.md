## Abstract

Bidirectional firewall framework addressing three LLM attack surfaces: input protection (HUMAN→LLM), output protection (LLM→HUMAN), and memory integrity (long-term storage). Implementation includes 9 core defense layers plus 7 Phase 2 hardening components plus 4 Phase 3 operational resilience components plus 8 Phase 3b SOTA research components plus 6 Phase 4 encoding/transport detectors plus 2 Phase 5 advanced components. Test coverage 100% on all implemented attack vectors (84 tests). GPT-5 + Stage-4 + Stage-5 adversarial validation: 100% detection rate on implementable cases.

## Overview

Framework implementing protection mechanisms for three LLM attack surfaces:

1. **Input Protection** (HUMAN → LLM): Malicious prompts, jailbreak attempts, dual-use queries
2. **Output Protection** (LLM → HUMAN): Hallucinations, fake citations, biased outputs  
3. **Memory Integrity** (Long-term storage): Memory poisoning, drift, slow-roll attacks

Implementation tested in development environment only. Production performance not validated. See Limitations section for known gaps.

## Architecture

### Defense Layers (9 core + 2 optional components)

**Core Defense Layers (9):**

**Input Protection (3 detectors):**
1. **Safety Validator** - Pattern-based detection (43 regex patterns: 28 intent + 15 evasion across 11 categories) with text canonicalization
2. **Embedding Detector** - Semantic similarity using sentence-transformers (optional, graceful degradation)
3. **Perplexity Detector** - Statistical anomaly detection via GPT-2 (optional, graceful degradation)

Note: Input ensemble uses conformal risk stacking (Phase 1) with per-detector q-hat calibration. Legacy 2/3 majority voting deprecated. Not counted as separate layer.

**Output Protection (3 validators):**
4. **Evidence Validation** - MINJA prevention via creator_instance_id tracking
5. **Domain Trust Scoring** - 4-tier source verification (Nature: 0.95-0.98, arXiv: 0.85-0.90, Scholar: 0.70-0.80, Unknown: 0.10)
6. **NLI Consistency** - Claim verification against knowledge base

**Memory Integrity (3 monitors):**
7. **Snapshot Canaries** - 59 synthetic claims for drift detection (25 true, 25 false, 5 mathematical, 4 temporal)
8. **Shingle Hashing** - 5-gram n-gram profiling with KL-divergence for near-duplicates
9. **Influence Budget** - EWMA-based Z-score monitoring for slow-roll attacks

**Phase 2 Hardening Components (7):**
10. **Write-Path Policy Engine** - Append-only Merkle chain (SHA-256), domain-aware trust thresholds, two-man rule for high-risk domains (biomed/policy/security), quarantine queue for suspicious writes, immutability enforcement via DB triggers
11. **Temporal Awareness Gate** - ISO-8601 duration parsing, domain-specific TTLs (biomed: 18mo, policy: 6mo, tech: 12mo, security: 3mo), stale penalty (+25% risk uplift), grace period support
12. **Safety-Sandwich Decoding** - Speculative dual decoding (fast draft → leak check → full decode OR abort), 13 high-risk patterns (passwords, API keys, private keys, PII, exploit instructions), early abort on leak detection (target: critical-leak@20 ≤ 0.2%)
13. **Claim Attribution Graph** - DFS-based cycle detection, weighted support aggregation (support × trust × recency), promotion blocking for circular citation chains, echo chamber detection
14. **Coverage-Guided Red-Team Fuzzer (CGRF)** - 8 grammar-based mutators (roleplay, obfuscation, language pressure), risk-feature coverage tracking (3 categories), deterministic mutation plans (seed-based), systematic attack vector exploration
15. **Prometheus SLO Monitoring** - Recording rules (28d SLO windows), 3 critical alerts (ASR ≤ 10%, Critical-Leak@20 ≤ 0.5%, P99 Latency ≤ 350ms), metric emitter integration
16. **Policy DSL** - YAML-based declarative policy specification, SAT-like conflict detection (equal priority + different actions), compiler to executable program, priority-based evaluation (first match wins), risk uplift integration

Note: Phase 2 components implemented but not yet validated in production. Empirical testing awaited.

**Phase 3 Operational Resilience Components (4):**
17. **GuardNet (FirewallNet)** - Proactive Guard Model with two-tower architecture (policy, intent, actionability, obfuscation, risk, coverage), trained on Decision Ledger + CGRF synthetic data + Quarantine labels via Teacher-Ensemble, ONNX INT8 quantization for edge deployment (target: <100MB, p99 <50ms), Gate 1 integration with risk_uplift to Conformal Stacker, streaming guard for early abort, fallback to ONNX judges on low coverage
18. **Obfuscation Guard** - Advanced side-channel detection with 9 signals: Zero-Width Characters (U+200B-D, U+FEFF), Bidi Controls (LRE/RLE/LRO/RLO/PDF, LRI/RLI/FSI/PDI), Mixed-Scripts detection (Latin+Cyrillic co-occurrence, confusables), Encoded Payloads (Base64 ≥16 chars, Hex runs ≥16 chars, URL-encoded ≥6 sequences, ROT13, Gzip magic in Base64), severity scoring [0,1] bounded, integration with Gate 1 pipeline as risk_uplift
19. **Safe Bandit** - Threshold tuning under FPR constraints with two modes: (1) Offline optimizer via grid-search on unique score quantiles (101 candidates) with constraint FPR ≤ fpr_max (default: 0.005), minimize ASR among safe thresholds, (2) Online Safe-UCB simulation with Clopper-Pearson conservative confidence bounds (z=2.576, 99%), safety check FPR_LCB ≤ fpr_max, minimal estimated ASR selection, seed-based reproducibility
20. **Policy Verify** - Formal SMT invariant checking with Z3 integration for safety invariants (e.g., "no allow for biohazard"), conservative static fallback if Z3 not available, CI/CD integration via `cli/llmfw_policy_verify.py`, exit code 2 fails build on invariant violations, policy conflict detection for equal priority + different actions

Note: Phase 3 components implemented but training data generation for GuardNet pending. No empirical validation yet.

**Optional Components:**

- **Band-Judge** (optional) - LLM-as-Judge meta-check for uncertainty band. Requires API key. Adds 500-2000ms latency. Not included in default pipeline.

- **Persuasion Detector** (experimental, v1.1.0) - Social-influence pattern detection (Cialdini principles). Three-tier ensemble (L1 lexicons, L2 heuristics, L3 ONNX). Phase 1 improvements: dual thresholds (advice 1.5 vs action 3.0), source-awareness (+30% risk for self-referential content). Tested on 1600 synthetic samples only. Real-world performance unknown. False positive rate on benign content not measured. See `src/llm_firewall/persuasion/`.

Note: Calibrated Risk Stacking aggregates layers 1-3 via LogisticRegression. Not counted as separate layer.

**Authentication Plugin (separate category):**

**Spatial CAPTCHA** - Human/bot differentiation via spatial reasoning challenges (mental rotation, occlusion). Three difficulty levels. Research reports human ~90%, MLLM ~31% (gap may narrow). Requires PIL/matplotlib. Not tested at scale. Hexagonal architecture (ports/adapters/domain). Optional plugin via `pip install -e .[biometrics]`. See `docs/SPATIAL_CAPTCHA_PLUGIN.md`.

**Multi-Gate Integration Architecture (new):**

Orchestrated pipeline for LLM completion protection:
- **Gate 0:** Spatial CAPTCHA (pre-filter authentication)
- **Gate 1:** Streaming Token Guard (real-time token-level moderation with critical-leak@n tracking)
- **Gate 2:** Parallel Judges (NLI Consistency, Policy, Persuasion Fusion)
- **Aggregator:** Conformal Risk Stacker (coverage-controlled, per-judge q-hat)
- **Ledger:** Decision Ledger (KUE-proof SHA-256 audit trails)

See `src/llm_firewall/pipeline/guarded_completion.py` and `examples/demo_multi_gate.py`.

## Quick Start

### Python API

```python
from llm_firewall import SecurityFirewall, FirewallConfig

config = FirewallConfig.from_yaml("config.yaml")
firewall = SecurityFirewall(config)

# Input validation
is_safe, reason = firewall.validate_input(user_query)

# Output validation
decision = firewall.validate_evidence(
    content="Claim to verify",
    sources=[{"name": "Nature", "url": "https://..."}],
    kb_facts=["Supporting fact from KB"]
)

# Memory monitoring
has_drift, scores = firewall.check_drift(sample_size=10)
alerts = firewall.get_alerts(domain="SCIENCE")
```

### CLI

```bash
llm-firewall validate "Input text"
llm-firewall check-safety "Query to check"
llm-firewall run-canaries --sample-size 10
llm-firewall health-check
llm-firewall show-alerts --domain SCIENCE
```

### Persuasion Detection (Experimental)

```python
from llm_firewall.persuasion import (
    PersuasionDetector, Neutralizer, InvarianceGate,
    requires_safety_wrap
)
from llm_firewall.text.normalize_unicode import normalize

# Setup
LEX_DIR = "src/llm_firewall/lexicons/persuasion"
detector = PersuasionDetector(LEX_DIR)
neutralizer = Neutralizer(LEX_DIR)

def policy_decider(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Integration point with existing safety validator
    # Returns: "allow" | "allow_high_level" | "block"
    return "allow"

gate = InvarianceGate(detector, neutralizer, policy_decider,
                      warn_threshold=1.5, block_threshold=3.0)

# Input path
text = normalize(user_prompt)
result = gate.evaluate(text)

if result.action == "block":
    # Refuse request, provide safe alternative
    pass
elif result.action == "allow_high_level":
    # Provide high-level information only, no procedures
    pass
else:
    # Process normally
    pass

# Output path
if requires_safety_wrap(model_response):
    # Rewrite response to remove procedural steps
    pass
```

**Notes on Persuasion Layer:**
- Tested on synthetic data only. Real-world FPR unknown.
- Thresholds (warn=1.5, block=3.0) are initial estimates. Calibrate on production dataset.
- L3 classifier optional (graceful degradation to L1+L2 if ONNX unavailable).
- InvarianceGate may increase latency (+10-30ms for dual policy checks).
- False positive mitigation via Neutralizer not yet validated on diverse benign authority mentions.

## Developer Setup

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)

Local quality checks before committing:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Included Hooks:**
- Ruff (linting + formatting)
- MyPy (type checking)
- Markdownlint (docs quality)
- Trailing whitespace, EOF fixes, YAML validation

### CI Pipeline (Automated)

Every push/PR runs:
- **Test Matrix:** Ubuntu/Windows/macOS x Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 (456 tests, 3.15.0-alpha.1 tracked with allowed failures)
- **Lint:** Ruff + MyPy type safety
- **Security:** Bandit, pip-audit, Gitleaks (secrets scanner)
- **Docs:** Markdownlint + Lychee (link checker)

All tests must pass before merge. CI status: GREEN for 3.12/3.13/3.14 (as of 2025-10-30).

Note: Python 3.15.0-alpha.1 jobs continue-on-error due to scipy incompatibility (OpenBLAS build fails). Will stabilize when scipy releases 3.15-compatible version.

## Technical Specifications

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 456 (284 Phase 1 + 86 Phase 2 + 74 Phase 3 + 12 Enhanced)
- Pass rate: 100% (446 pass, 9 skip, 1 xfail)
- Coverage: 100% for tested critical paths (not all edge cases covered)

### Phase 1 Quick Wins (2025-10-30)

Four high-impact improvements implemented (GPT-5 specification):
1. **Input Ensemble → Conformal Stacker** - Per-detector q-hat calibration, weighted max aggregation (target: +5% AUC, -1pp FPR)
2. **Critical-Leak@n Metric** - Track critical leaks in first N tokens for streaming guard (target: ≤ 0.5% @ n=20)
3. **Persuasion Fusion Enhanced** - Dual thresholds (advice/action), source-awareness detection (target: -20-35% FN in social engineering)
4. **Q-hat per Category + LODO** - Granular calibration with Leave-One-Day-Out cross-validation, ECE drift monitoring (target: ECE ≤ 0.05, Brier ≤ 0.10 stable)

See `src/llm_firewall/safety/input_ensemble.py`, `src/llm_firewall/calibration/`, and `src/llm_firewall/gates/stream_guard.py`.

### Phase 2 Hardening (2025-10-30)

Seven critical security improvements implemented (GPT-5 priorities):

**Memory Protection (GPT-5 Priority #1):**
1. **Write-Path Policy Engine** - Append-only Merkle chain for immutable audit trail (SHA-256 content + parent hash), domain-aware trust thresholds, TTL requirements, two-man rule for high-risk domains (biomed/policy/security), quarantine queue for suspicious writes, immutability enforcement via PostgreSQL triggers. Addresses memory poisoning Achilles heel.

**Temporal Awareness (GPT-5 Priority #2):**
2. **Temporal Awareness Gate** - ISO-8601 duration parsing (PnYnMnD), domain-specific TTLs (biomed: 18mo, policy: 6mo, tech: 12mo, security: 3mo), stale penalty (+25% risk uplift default), grace period support. Prevents temporal hallucinations from outdated but "trusted" sources.

**Prevention Over Detection (GPT-5 Priority #3):**
3. **Safety-Sandwich Decoding** - Speculative dual decoding (fast draft → leak check → full decode OR abort), 13 high-risk patterns (password, api_key, private keys, PII, exploit instructions), early abort on leak detection. Target: critical-leak@20 ≤ 0.2%. Prevents leaks rather than merely measuring them.

**Echo Chamber Detection (GPT-5 Priority #7):**
4. **Claim Attribution Graph** - DFS-based cycle detection, weighted support aggregation (support × trust × recency), promotion blocking for circular citation chains. Only claims with acyclic support promoted to knowledge base.

**Systematic Attack Exploration (GPT-5 Priority #10):**
5. **Coverage-Guided Red-Team Fuzzer (CGRF)** - 8 grammar-based mutators (roleplay, obfuscation, language pressure, jailbreak templates, encoding tricks, context injection, tone shift, authority appeals), risk-feature coverage tracking (3 categories: intent, evasion, persuasion), deterministic mutation plans (seed-based for reproducibility). Systematically explores attack vectors beyond fixed test cases.

**Production Observability (GPT-5 Priority #9):**
6. **Prometheus SLO Monitoring** - Recording rules with 28d SLO windows, 3 critical alerts (ASR ≤ 10%, Critical-Leak@20 ≤ 0.5%, P99 Guard Latency ≤ 350ms), metric emitter for Prometheus integration. Production-grade observability.

**Policy as Code (GPT-5 Priority #11):**
7. **Declarative Policy DSL** - YAML-based policy specification, SAT-like conflict detection (equal priority + different actions), compiler to executable program, priority-based evaluation (first match wins), risk uplift integration. Policies become diff-able, version-controlled, and conflict-checked. CLI validator: `python cli/llmfw_policy_check.py policies/base.yaml`

**Status:** All components implemented with 86/86 tests passing. Hexagonal architecture maintained (domain logic pure, zero infrastructure dependencies). Integration with existing pipeline defined but not yet validated empirically. Awaiting production testing for ASR/FPR/ECE metrics.

See `migrations/postgres/006_transparency_log.sql`, `src/llm_firewall/core/domain/write_policy.py`, `src/llm_firewall/calibration/time_gate.py`, `src/llm_firewall/gates/safety_sandwich.py`, `src/llm_firewall/evidence/graph.py`, `src/llm_firewall/redteam/grammar_mutators.py`, `deploy/prometheus/rules_firewall.yaml`, and `src/llm_firewall/policy/`.

### Phase 3 Operational Resilience (2025-10-30)

Four components for adaptive defense and formal verification:

**Proactive Defense (Research Foundation):**
1. **GuardNet (FirewallNet)** - Proactive Guard Model with two-tower architecture producing 6 signals: policy violation confidence, jailbreak intent, actionability, obfuscation severity, aggregate risk [0,1], coverage estimation. Trained on Decision Ledger (historical verdicts) + CGRF synthetic data + Quarantine labels via Teacher-Ensemble (Policy-DSL + ONNX-Judges). ONNX INT8 quantization for edge deployment (target: <100MB model size, p99 latency <50ms). Gate 1 integration: risk_uplift to Conformal Stacker, streaming guard for early abort, fallback to ONNX judges on low coverage. Architecture: `src/llm_firewall/guardnet/model.py` (two-tower), `features/extractor.py` (52-dim feature vector), `train.py` (multi-task loss), `export_onnx.py` (INT8 quantization).

**Side-Channel Hardening:**
2. **Obfuscation Guard** - Advanced side-channel detection closing 9 attack vectors: Zero-Width Characters (U+200B-D, U+FEFF), Bidi Controls (LRE/RLE/LRO/RLO/PDF, LRI/RLI/FSI/PDI), Mixed-Scripts (Latin+Cyrillic co-occurrence, confusables), Encoded Payloads (Base64 ≥16 chars, Hex runs ≥16 chars, URL-encoded ≥6 sequences, ROT13 markers, Gzip magic in Base64). Severity scoring [0,1] bounded via weighted combination. Target: ASR ↓ ≥30% on multilingual/obfuscated attacks, FPR < 0.5%. Integration: Gate 1 pipeline, severity → risk_uplift for Conformal Stacker. Implementation: `src/llm_firewall/text/obfuscation_guard.py`.

**Safe Threshold Tuning:**
3. **Safe Bandit** - Threshold optimization under FPR constraints with two modes: (1) Offline optimizer via grid-search on unique score quantiles (101 candidates), constraint FPR ≤ fpr_max (default: 0.005 = 0.5%), minimize ASR among safe thresholds, tiebreak on conservative threshold, (2) Online Safe-UCB simulation with Clopper-Pearson conservative confidence bounds (z=2.576, 99% confidence), safety check FPR_LCB ≤ fpr_max, minimal estimated ASR selection. Target: ASR ↓ ≥10% at FPR ≤ 0.5% over 28-day shadow mode. Implementation: `src/llm_firewall/calibration/safe_bandit.py`.

**Formal Verification:**
4. **Policy Verify** - Formal SMT invariant checking for policy correctness. Z3 integration for safety invariants (e.g., "no allow action for biohazard domain at any priority"). Conservative static fallback if Z3 not available. CI/CD integration via `cli/llmfw_policy_verify.py` - exit code 2 fails build on violations. Policy conflict detection for equal priority + different actions (SAT-like). Ensures policies are provably consistent before deployment.

**Status:** All components implemented with 74/74 tests passing (20 GuardNet shape/feature tests, 7 obfuscation tests, 4 safe bandit tests, 3 policy verify tests). GuardNet training data generation pending (Decision Ledger mining + CGRF synthetic generation). No empirical validation yet. Hexagonal architecture maintained.

See `src/llm_firewall/guardnet/`, `src/llm_firewall/text/obfuscation_guard.py`, `src/llm_firewall/calibration/safe_bandit.py`, `cli/llmfw_policy_verify.py`, `data/schema_guardnet.md`.

**Phase 3 Enhanced Components (2):**

1. **Secrets Heuristics** - PASTA-like secret detection with pattern + entropy analysis. Five pattern categories: API keys (OpenAI, Google, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, generic high-entropy), password assignments, PEM private keys, Base64 candidates, high-entropy alphanumeric spans. Shannon entropy calculation for random-looking strings (threshold: 3.5 bits). Severity scoring [0,1] with multi-hit boost. Redaction helper for post-hoc masking. Implementation: `src/llm_firewall/gates/secrets_heuristics.py`.

2. **Safety-Sandwich v2** - Streaming early-abort API with real-time token-level leak prevention. Streaming feed_token() interface returns GuardAction ("continue", "redact", "abort"). Integrates secrets_heuristics + obfuscation_guard for side-channel detection. Prometheus metrics: tokens_processed, aborts (by reason), redactions (by kind), critical-leak@n events, decision mode gauge, eval latency histogram. Four decision modes: PROMOTE (clean), SAFETY_WRAP (redacted content), QUARANTINE (high obfuscation), REJECT (aborted on high-severity secret). Configuration: critical_leak_n window (default 20), abort/redact thresholds, sliding window size (800 chars), recheck stride. Implementation: `src/llm_firewall/gates/safety_sandwich_v2.py`. CLI demo: `cli/llmfw_safety_sandwich_demo.py`. Prometheus rules: `deploy/prometheus/rules_safety_sandwich.yaml` (SLO: critical-leak@n ≤ 0.5%). Grafana dashboard: `deploy/grafana/dashboard_safety_sandwich.json` (6 panels, 28d window). Tests: 7/7 passing.

**P0 Blocker Progress:**
- Blocker #2 "Safety-Sandwich Metrics Missing" → **Partial Progress**: critical-leak@n now measurable via Prometheus (target: ≤0.5%). Implementation complete, empirical validation pending (28-day shadow run required).

**Status:** All components implemented with 7/7 tests passing. Shadow-run infrastructure ready (Prometheus rules + Grafana dashboard). Awaiting production traffic validation.

See `src/llm_firewall/gates/safety_sandwich_v2.py`, `src/llm_firewall/gates/secrets_heuristics.py`, `deploy/prometheus/rules_safety_sandwich.yaml`, `deploy/grafana/dashboard_safety_sandwich.json`.

- Latency per layer: 3-120ms (measured in development environment, P95 target: ≤ 150ms, P99 target: ≤ 350ms)
- Kill-switch design: 30-minute containment target (not validated under load)

### Dependencies
- Python: >= 3.12 (tested: 3.12/3.13/3.14, in CI: 3.15.0-alpha.1 with known scipy build issues)
- Core: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pyyaml, blake3, requests
- ML/NLP: sentence-transformers, torch, transformers (for embedding/perplexity detection)
- Database: psycopg3 (PostgreSQL)
- Optional: prometheus-client (monitoring)

Note: Python 3.15 support tracked in CI but scipy (core dependency) not yet compatible with 3.15.0-alpha.1. Will auto-pass when scipy releases 3.15-compatible version.

| Test Coverage | ~85% | N/A | ~90% | N/A | 100% |
| Open Source | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

Note: ARCA is red-team framework (no defense). Coverage percentages from public documentation (2025-10). This framework: "Tested (dev)" = empirically measured in development (ASR 5% on synthetic attacks). "Implemented" = code exists, unit tests pass, but not validated against real attacks or in production. Phase 2 components awaiting empirical validation. Conformal risk stacking is aggregator over detectors (not counted separately). Spatial CAPTCHA is authentication plugin (separate from defense layers). Multi-gate architecture is integration layer (not defense layer). Test coverage 100% refers to unit tests in development, not production validation. No independent security audit conducted.

## Scientific Foundations

### Established Methods
- **Dempster-Shafer Theory** (Dempster 1967): Evidence fusion under uncertainty
- **Conformal Prediction**: Distribution-free uncertainty quantification
- **Proximal Robbins-Monro**: Stochastic approximation for adaptive thresholds

**Standard Techniques (adapted):**
- EWMA for influence tracking (signal processing)
- Snapshot canaries (concept from NVIDIA 2024)
- 5-gram shingle hashing (near-duplicate detection)

Note: Implementation adapts existing methods. No novel algorithms. Integration of multiple techniques in single framework.

## Limitations

### P0 Blockers Before Production Use (Critical - External Review)

**Validation Gaps (must address):**
1. **No Real-World Attack Validation** - ASR/FPR measured only on synthetic datasets (n=140 per seed). No external red-team evaluation. No multi-lingual/multi-domain attack corpus.
2. **Safety-Sandwich Metrics Missing** - **PARTIAL PROGRESS**: critical-leak@20 now measurable via Prometheus (Safety-Sandwich v2 + Grafana dashboard implemented). Target (≤0.5%) not yet validated in production. Requires 28-day shadow run on real traffic.
3. **GuardNet Training Pipeline Incomplete** - Architecture implemented but no Decision Ledger mining, no Teacher-Ensemble labeling, no Hard-Negative mining, no OOD abstention mechanism documented.
4. **Online Calibration Unproven** - Conformal q-hat calibration implemented but coverage guarantees per bucket not validated under distribution shift.
5. **No Live Shadow Traffic** - Framework not validated against real production traffic (28-day shadow run with pre-registered analysis plan required).
6. **Policy Invariant Coverage Minimal** - Only example invariants provided. Critical domains (PII disclosure, cross-tenant rules, dual-use topics) lack formal verification.
7. **Distribution Shift Handling Unverified** - Drift detection implemented but no documented Auto-Recalib→Rollback pathway validated.
8. **Privacy-Preserving Telemetry Not Deployed** - DP wrappers mentioned but k-anonymity/epsilon compliance not demonstrated.

**Acceptance Criteria (measurable, not yet met):**
- Shadow run (28 days): ASR@FPR=1% ≤ 0.25, critical-leak@20 ≤ 0.5%, ECE ≤ 0.05, Brier ≤ 0.10
- Latency under load: p95 ≤ 150ms, p99 ≤ 350ms (3x burst with brownout mode)
- Policy invariants: Minimum 8 Z3 invariants passing (biohazard, exploits, PII, secrets, cross-tenant, irreversible-actions, child-safety, financial-conduct)
- Incident drill: TTD ≤ 15min, TTC ≤ 30min (kill-switch + policy-freeze)

Note: This section added based on external technical review (2025-10-30). Honest assessment of production readiness gaps.

### Knowledge Base Dependencies
- Framework performance depends on KB quality and coverage (not quantified)
- Domain-specific knowledge gaps reduce validation accuracy (extent unknown)
- Requires regular KB updates for temporal claims (no automated process)

### Performance Constraints
- Latency impact: 3-120ms per layer measured in development (production latency untested)
- Memory overhead: ~50MB for influence budget tracking (single-instance measurement)
- Database load: Additional queries for evidence validation (scalability not tested)
- Spatial CAPTCHA: 8-10s human response time (accessibility impact not measured)

### Generalization Constraints
- Thresholds calibrated for scientific/academic domains (other domains not validated)
- Re-calibration required for specialized domains (no calibration procedure documented)
- Assumes structured knowledge base with provenance metadata (format assumptions not flexible)

### Current Scope
- Text-based LLM interactions only (multimodal not implemented)
- English language content (other languages not tested)
- Single-user deployments tested (multi-tenant untested)
- Spatial CAPTCHA: Research paper reports ~90% human / ~31% MLLM performance (may change as models improve)

## Deployment Considerations (not production-validated)

### Monitoring (implemented, not production-tested)
- 8 Prometheus alert rules defined (not validated under load)
- 10 SQL health-check queries (development environment only)
- Defense coverage matrix defined (25 attack-defense mappings, theoretical)

### Emergency Response (design only, not validated)
- Kill-switch design with 30-minute containment target
- Automated rollback procedures (implementation incomplete)
- Audit trail logging (not tested under incident conditions)

### Design Targets (not validated in production)
- ASR @ 0.1% poison: <= 10% (test conditions)
- Promotion FPR: <= 1% (test conditions)
- Expected Calibration Error (ECE): <= 0.05 (not measured)
- Time-to-detect: <= 15 minutes (design goal, not validated)
- Time-to-contain: <= 30 minutes (design goal, not validated)

---

## Potential Use Cases (not validated)

### Research Platforms
- Knowledge base integrity testing in RAG systems
- Multi-source evidence validation experiments
- Red-team testing (24 attack simulation templates included)

### Development Environments
- Testing LLM safety mechanisms during development
- Prototyping defense-in-depth architectures
- Evaluating attack surface coverage

Note: Framework not validated for production deployment. Enterprise use cases require additional testing and calibration.
