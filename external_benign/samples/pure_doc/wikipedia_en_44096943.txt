Jersey Girl is a 1992 American romantic comedy drama film directed by David Burton Morris.


Plot

Toby, a working-class preschool teacher from New Jersey, feels her life is purposeless and uninteresting. While at dinner with her friends, she decides she wants to change her fate. After talking to her friends about what the ideal man is like, she travels to New York to find him. She walks into a Mercedes-Benz dealership, but feels uncomfortable and leaves. While trying to back out of the parking lot, she nearly hits a man, named Sal, driving a brand-new car. He drives around her and leaves the parking lot, but she's smitten. She follows him down the road, and ultimately ends up causing an accident resulting in significant damage to Sal's car. They exchange information, and she decides to actively pursue him.
