Caminito de Gloria is a 1939 Argentine musical melodrama film written and directed by Luis César Amadori during the Golden Age of Argentine cinema. The film stars Libertad Lamarque, who sings "Caminito", the celebrated 1926 tango composed by Juan de Dios Filiberto with lyrics by Coria Peñaloza originally popularized by Carlos Gardel and Ignacio Corsini. In 1960 Amadori remade this film under the title Mi último tango (English "My Last Tango "), starring Sara Montiel in the role previously played by Lamarque.
