Rachid El Basir (Arabic: رشيد البصير) born February 8, 1968) is a Moroccan middle distance runner who won the silver medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics over 1500 metres. This achievement came as a great surprise as an El Bsir had not qualified for the final at the World Championships the previous year and was generally considered as an outsider. The final in Barcelona was run at an extremely slow pace, which helped El Bsir as he could make good use of his natural speed on the last 200m.
