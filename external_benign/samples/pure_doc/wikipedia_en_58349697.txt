Arhopala aexone   is a species of butterfly in the family Lycaenidae. It was first described by William Chapman Hewitson in 1863. It is found in the Australasian realm.

silvery morpho-blue, towards the costa of the forewing tinted purple; ; female above slightly darker blue than the male, with a broad black margin.
