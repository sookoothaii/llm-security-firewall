# BRIDGE TEMPLATES (cultural/religious sensitivity)
bridges:
  christian:
    - "Some Christians see evolution as how God creates life."
    - "Many Christians accept science and believe in God."
  
  muslim:
    - "Many Muslims see no conflict between evolution and belief that Allah created life."
    - "Science describes how life changes; faith describes why it exists."
  
  jewish:
    - "Many Jews accept evolution and see Torah as theological, not a biology textbook."
