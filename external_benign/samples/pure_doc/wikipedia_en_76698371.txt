This list of Baltimore Black Sox seasons compiles games played by the Baltimore Black Sox. Seasons in which the Black Sox were league members (or an associate team), only games that counted in official league standings are included. Seasons in which they had no league membership and played an independent/barnstorming schedule include games against primarily major-league-caliber teams.
Contemporary coverage of games and won-loss standings was spotty and inconsistent.  On-going research continuously discovers unreported or misreported games, while some games are probably lost forever.  Therefore, Negro league seasonal finishes will likely remain incomplete and subjective.
