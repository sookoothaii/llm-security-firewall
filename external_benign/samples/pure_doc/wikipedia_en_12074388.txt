Pretty Girls is the second studio album by Canadian singer Lisa Dalbello, released in 1979 by Talisman Records. Following her departure from MCA Records, the album was initially an independent release before being picked up by Capitol Records for a wider distribution. The title track, "Pretty Girls," gained notable attention when Melissa Manchester’s cover version became a US Top 40 hit later that year. Dalbello’s performance on the album earned her a Juno Award nomination for Female Vocalist of the Year in 1979, her second such honor. The album reflects her early pop and soul roots, setting the stage for her later shift toward alternative rock.
