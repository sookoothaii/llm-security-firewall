History
A two-story brick school was built in Big Rapids in 1859. A school had been built in another district in Green Township the year prior. In 1868, the two districts merged, forming a union school district. The new union school, which contained a high school, opened in 1870, and by that year several grade schools had also been built in the city.
By 1881, the union school was in danger of falling into Mitchell Creek. A new high school was built that year and opened in January 1882.
In fall 1925, a new high school opened as an addition to a school built around 1900. A bond issue to build four elementary schools passed in 1954.
By 1960, the high school was dangerously overcrowded, and "housed 787 in grades 7 through 12. It was built for 400 to 500 pupils," according to the Grand Rapids Press. "Classrooms in both the old section and the newer addition built in 1924 are poorly lit and improperly ventilated... The odor of stale perspiration permeates the building." Where to build a new high school, if at all, was a matter of great controversy in Big Rapids.
The district attempted to pass bond issues to replace the high school three times before one was approved by voters in 1962. A new high school, designed by architecture firm Daverman Associates of Grand Rapids, opened in February 1964.  The previous high school then became a middle school.
The current high school opened in January 1998. Designed by GMB Architects and Engineers, it was featured in the 1999 Architectural Portfolio of American School & University magazine. The The 1964 building is currently the district's middle school.
