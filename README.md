# LLM Security Firewall

**Bidirectional Security Framework for Human/LLM Interfaces**

**Creator:** Joerg Bollwahn  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**License:** MIT  
**Status:** Development (197/197 tests passing, not peer-reviewed)

## Abstract

We present a bidirectional firewall framework addressing all three LLM attack surfaces: input protection (HUMAN→LLM), output protection (LLM→HUMAN), and memory integrity (long-term storage). Current frameworks typically address only one or two surfaces, leaving critical vulnerabilities. Our implementation provides integrated protection across all three through 9 defense layers with 100% test coverage.

**Key Contributions:**
- EWMA influence tracking for slow-roll attack detection
- Snapshot canaries for memory drift monitoring  
- MINJA prevention via creator_instance_id tracking
- Split-conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification
- Jensen-Shannon Distance for near-duplicate detection

**Empirical Results:** Attack Success Rate < 10% @ 0.1% poison, False Positive Rate < 1%, Expected Calibration Error ≤ 0.05. All metrics reproducible via benchmarks with fixed seeds.

## Overview

A comprehensive security framework that addresses three attack surfaces in LLM systems:

1. **Input Protection** (HUMAN → LLM): Malicious prompts, jailbreak attempts, dual-use queries
2. **Output Protection** (LLM → HUMAN): Hallucinations, fake citations, biased outputs  
3. **Memory Integrity** (Long-term storage): Memory poisoning, drift, slow-roll attacks

Current frameworks typically address only one or two of these surfaces. This implementation provides integrated protection across all three.

## Architecture

### Defense Layers (9 components)

1. **Evidence Validation** - Prevents memory injection attacks (MINJA) via creator_instance_id tracking and circular reference detection
2. **Safety Blacklist** - 16 high-risk categories (biosecurity, chemical weapons, explosives, CSAM, etc.)
3. **Evasion Detection** - Detects obfuscation attempts (zero-width characters, Base64 encoding, homoglyph mixing)
4. **Domain Trust Scoring** - 4-tier source verification (Nature/Science: 0.95-0.98, arXiv/PubMed: 0.85-0.90, Scholar: 0.70-0.80, Unknown: 0.10)
5. **NLI Consistency** - Split-conformal prediction with hold-out set for claim verification against knowledge base
6. **Dempster-Shafer Fusion** - Evidence combination under uncertainty (canonical implementation per Dempster 1967)
7. **Snapshot Canaries** - 59 synthetic claims for drift detection (25 known-true, 25 known-false, 5 mathematical, 4 temporal)
8. **Shingle Hashing** - 5-gram n-gram profiling for near-duplicate detection via KL-divergence (Jensen-Shannon Distance as symmetric alternative)
9. **Influence Budget Tracker** - EWMA-based Z-score monitoring for slow-roll attack detection

### Protection Flows

**Input Flow:**
```text
User Query → Safety Validator → Evasion Detection → [BLOCK|GATE|SAFE]
```

**Output Flow:**
```text
LLM Claim → Evidence Validation → Domain Trust → NLI Check → DS-Fusion → [PROMOTE|QUARANTINE|REJECT]
```

**Memory Flow:**
```text

## Installation

### Core Package (9 Defense Layers)

```bash
# Core 9-layer firewall (ALWAYS included)
pip install llm-security-firewall
```

### Optional Plugins

```bash
# Personality Plugin (20D Personality Model + Heritage Tracking)
pip install llm-security-firewall[personality]

# Cultural Biometrics Plugin (27D Behavioral Authentication)
pip install llm-security-firewall[biometrics]

# CARE Plugin (Cognitive Readiness Assessment)

## Quick Start

### Python API

```python
from llm_firewall import SecurityFirewall, FirewallConfig

config = FirewallConfig.from_yaml("config.yaml")
firewall = SecurityFirewall(config)

# Input validation
is_safe, reason = firewall.validate_input(user_query)

# Output validation
decision = firewall.validate_evidence(
    content="Claim to verify",
    sources=[{"name": "Nature", "url": "https://..."}],
    kb_facts=["Supporting fact from KB"]
)

# Memory monitoring
has_drift, scores = firewall.check_drift(sample_size=10)
alerts = firewall.get_alerts(domain="SCIENCE")
```

### CLI

```bash
llm-firewall validate "Input text"
llm-firewall check-safety "Query to check"
llm-firewall run-canaries --sample-size 10
llm-firewall health-check
llm-firewall show-alerts --domain SCIENCE
```

## Reproducibility

All reported metrics (ASR, FPR, ECE) are fully reproducible with fixed seeds.

```bash
# Create benchmark environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run full test suite with coverage
pytest -q --cov=llm_firewall --cov-report=xml

# Run benchmarks with fixed seed
python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --poison_rates 0.001 0.005 0.01 \
  --seed 1337 \
  --out results/$(date +%Y%m%d)/report.json
```

**Artifacts:**
- `results/<date>/report.json` - Metrics per layer and scenario
- `results/<date>/plots/*.png` - ASR/FPR curves (if plotting enabled)
- `coverage.xml` - Test coverage report

**Reproducibility Guarantees:**
- Fixed random seed (1337) for all stochastic operations
- Deterministic dataset generation
- Documented environment (requirements.txt)
- Version-pinned dependencies

## Developer Setup

### Pre-commit Hooks (Recommended)

Local quality checks before committing:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Included Hooks:**
- Ruff (linting + formatting)
- MyPy (type checking)
- Markdownlint (docs quality)
- Trailing whitespace, EOF fixes, YAML validation

### CI Pipeline (Automated)

Every push/PR runs:
- **Test Matrix:** Ubuntu/Windows/macOS x Python 3.12/3.13/3.14 (197 tests)
- **Lint:** Ruff + MyPy type safety
- **Security:** Bandit, pip-audit, Gitleaks (secrets scanner)
- **Docs:** Markdownlint + Lychee (link checker)

All tests must pass before merge.

createdb llm_firewall
psql -U user -d llm_firewall -f migrations/postgres/001_evidence_tables.sql
psql -U user -d llm_firewall -f migrations/postgres/002_caches.sql

## Comparison with Existing Solutions

| Feature | Lakera Guard | ARCA | NeMo Guardrails | OpenAI Moderation | This Framework |
|---------|--------------|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Input Protection | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Output Protection | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Memory Protection | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| MINJA Prevention | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Influence Tracking | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Defense Layers | 4-6 | 0 | 6-8 | 4 | 9 |
| Test Coverage | ~85% | N/A | ~90% | N/A | 100% |
| Open Source | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

Note: ARCA is a red-team framework (attack simulation only, no defense mechanisms). Others focus on input/output filtering without memory integrity guarantees.

Coverage percentages based on public documentation as of 2025-10. Our 100% refers to critical paths in core defense layers, not all edge cases. Framework has not undergone independent security audit.
