The 1999 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup ran from June to October 1999, open to all soccer teams in the United States. It was the first Open Cup tournament to be named after Lamar Hunt. The Rochester Raging Rhinos of the A-League defeated the Colorado Rapids 2–0 in the final at Columbus Crew Stadium in Columbus, Ohio. The Rhinos became the first, and as of 2024, only non-Division I team to win the Open Cup since the inception of Major League Soccer, defeating four MLS teams in the tournament. Another A-League team, the Charleston Battery, also reached the semifinals, and the A-League's Staten Island Vipers were the other non-division one squad to beat an MLS team.
