History
Kastrati Group was founded in 1991 by Shefqet Kastrati during Albania's transition from communism to a market economy. Initially focused on fuel distribution, the company rapidly expanded its operations into various sectors, including construction, energy, and trading.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, Kastrati Group established a widespread network of petrol stations and entered the bulk terminal business with the development of MBM Port in Porto-Romano. The company played a pivotal role in Albania's infrastructural development, undertaking major projects such as commercial and residential complexes in Tirana and other key cities.
In 2020, Kastrati Group made a landmark acquisition by purchasing a 100% stake in Tirana International Airport, Albania's main international airport, further solidifying its presence in the country's strategic industries.
Over the last decade, Kastrati Group has continued to diversify its portfolio, venturing into insurance with Albsig, automotive distribution with Auto Star (Mercedes-Benz), retail chains, and media ownership including Euronews Albania.
Today, Kastrati Group stands as one of Albania's largest and most influential conglomerates, playing a critical role in the country's economic development and regional business landscape.
