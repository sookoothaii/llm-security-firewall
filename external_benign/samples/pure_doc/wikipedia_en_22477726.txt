Career
Watton played for Bromsgrove Rovers and Dutch side De Graafschap before joining Norman Low's Port Vale in September 1962. He made his debut in a 1–0 win at Colchester United on 10 September 1962, but only made four further Third Division appearances that season. He did not appear under new boss Freddie Steele in the 1963–64 season, and left Vale Park for Doncaster Rovers in July 1964. Rovers finished ninth in the Fourth Division in 1964–65 under the stewardship of Bill Leivers, before winning the league in 1965–66 after finishing ahead of Darlington on goal difference. They could not survive in the league above under new boss Keith Kettleborough, however, and were relegated in 1966–67 after finishing nine points short of safety. They finished tenth in the Fourth Division in 1967–68 under the management of George Raynor. Watton then left Belle Vue and later played for Southern League side Burton Albion.
