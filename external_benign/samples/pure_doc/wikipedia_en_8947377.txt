Warwick Road is an arterial east–west road located in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia.


History
Warwick Road was built in 1969 to service the Shire of Wanneroo parts of the Hamersley Development Scheme, which was later split into the suburbs of Duncraig, Warwick and Greenwood. Its original alignment, which was gazetted in 1949 as Road No. 10578 by the Wanneroo Road Board, was a straight east–west road extending to Alexander Drive, but in the mid-1970s, the alignment was altered southwards in the vicinity of the freeway alignment in preparation for connecting to the Mitchell Freeway when it was extended 1986. In the late 1970s, the section east of Wanneroo Road was split off to form Marangaroo Drive.
Apart from the Glengarry and Greenwood neighbourhood shopping centres, Warwick Road also passes Warwick Open Space east of Erindale Road and the Percy Doyle Reserve, which includes sports and recreation facilities and the Duncraig Library, near Marmion Avenue.
Renamed segments of the old alignment include Arnisdale Road west of the freeway, Tuart Road east of the freeway, and Mereworth Way/Warwick place east of Wanneroo Road. There is also a small, discontinuous, segment west of the intersection west of Marmion Avenue.
