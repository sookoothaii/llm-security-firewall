Daniel K. Winn (born June 19, 1966) is a Vietnamese-American artist, curator, and philanthropist.


Early life and education
Winn was born in Biên Hoa, Vietnam and lived there until 1975 when his family escaped to California, during the Fall of Saigon to escape Vietnamese communism. His family settled in Greater Los Angeles where Winn eventually attended the University of California, Irvine, earning a Bachelors of
Science. Winn then began medical school at the University of California, Irvine, School of Medicine with an intended focus in reconstructive surgery but left before receiving a degree to pursue a career in art.


Career as curator and artist
After leaving medical school, Winn began producing paintings and sculptures and opened a small frame shop and gallery in Southern California. By 1997, Winn owned galleries in Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. That same year he founded Masterpiece Publishing and spent the next 20 years mentoring and promoting artists, curating exhibitions throughout North America and China. During this time, Winn continued to refine his own style. Winn's sculptures and paintings have been exhibited in the United States, Spain, China, and Vietnam.
In 2019, the Shanghai Art Museum held a joint exhibit featuring the works of Winn and Dalí.
Winn has raised over $2 million for charities in the US and Asia. In 2018, Winn was knighted by Prince Waldemar of Schaumburg-Lippe in recognition of his philanthropic works.
In 2021, Winn was commissioned to create five new award statuettes for the Asian World Film Festival including the new Snow Leopard Award, the Red Cross Tiffany Ladies Circle Courage to Dream Award, the Benefactor Award, the Winn-Slavin Humanitarian Award, and the One Heart Award.
On April 22, 2023, Winn was featured on the Golden Globes Awards website with a story entitled "Sir Daniel Winn: A Tough Life from Vietnam to America and Success in Art and Film," which tells the story about Winn's rise to fame from poverty.
