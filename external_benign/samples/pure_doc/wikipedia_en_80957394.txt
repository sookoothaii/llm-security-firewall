Kathleen Allington (née Kersey 1889) was a British textile designer trained by the artist and craftsman William Morris. Allington designed wallpapers released by Morris & Co..


Designs
Three designs published by Morris & Co. are attributed to Allington, as Kersey: "Arbutus" (1913), "Verdure" (1913), and "Bird and Pomegranate"(c. 1926).
Allington is also known to have created further designs for textiles, wallpaper, tapestries and furnishing fabrics. The Victoria and Albert Museum holds several of her drawings including a pattern featuring green parakeets with flowers and fruits, monkeys and squirrels, and pink and green parrots. In 2025, the latter, now titled "Parrots", was adapted and printed on a range of items, including aprons and oven gloves, for sale in the Victoria and Albert Museum Shop.
