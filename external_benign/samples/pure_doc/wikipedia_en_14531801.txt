Three Greyhound-class destroyers served with the Royal Navy during the First World War.  Built in 1899–1902, Greyhound, Racehorse and Roebuck were three-funnelled turtle-backed destroyers, with the usual Hawthorn funnel tops, built by R. & W. Hawthorn, Leslie & Company at their Hebburn-on-Tyne shipyard.
They were virtually identical to the Mermaid-class destroyer built a couple of years earlier by the same company, except that they used a different type of water-tube boiler; Yarrow rather than Thornycroft. These four boilers produced 6,100 hp to given them the required thirty knots and they were armed with the standard 12-pounder guns and two torpedo tubes.  They carried a complement of 63 officers and men. In 1913 the three - like all other surviving three-funnelled destroyers of the "30-knotter" group - were re-classed as C-class destroyers.
