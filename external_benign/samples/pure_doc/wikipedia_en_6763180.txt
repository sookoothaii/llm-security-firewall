Live at the Ventura Theater is a live music DVD by the band Something Corporate. It was recorded on May 20, 2004 at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California after the release of their third album North and included songs from all three of their albums, including their label debut Leaving Through the Window and their independently released debut Ready... Break. This was the last release by the band before their hiatus, brought on primarily due to lead singer Andrew McMahon's side project Jack's Mannequin, as well as his subsequent diagnosis with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
