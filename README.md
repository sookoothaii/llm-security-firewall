# LLM Security Firewall

**Bidirectional Security Framework for Human/LLM Interfaces**

**Creator:** Joerg Bollwahn  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**License:** MIT  
**Status:** Development (206/206 tests passing, not peer-reviewed)

## Abstract

We present a bidirectional firewall framework addressing all three LLM attack surfaces: input protection (HUMAN→LLM), output protection (LLM→HUMAN), and memory integrity (long-term storage). Current frameworks typically address only one or two surfaces, leaving critical vulnerabilities. Our implementation provides integrated protection across all three through 9 core defense layers (plus 2 optional advanced components) with 100% test coverage.

**Key Contributions:**
- Multi-layer ensemble defense with graceful degradation (embedding, perplexity, pattern-based detection)
- Text canonicalization defeating Unicode-based evasion techniques
- 43-pattern jailbreak detection (28 intent + 15 evasion) across 7 attack categories
- MINJA prevention via creator_instance_id tracking
- 59-canary drift detection system with temporal and mathematical validation
- EWMA influence budget tracking for slow-roll attack detection
- Optional calibrated stacking and band-judge for research deployments

**Empirical Results:** Attack Success Rate 5.0% (±3.34%) across multi-seed validation (n=140 per seed, 4 seeds), reduced from initial 95% baseline (19-fold improvement). False Positive Rate 0.18%. All metrics reproducible via deterministic evaluation with fixed random seeds (1337-1340).

## Overview

A comprehensive security framework that addresses three attack surfaces in LLM systems:

1. **Input Protection** (HUMAN → LLM): Malicious prompts, jailbreak attempts, dual-use queries
2. **Output Protection** (LLM → HUMAN): Hallucinations, fake citations, biased outputs  
3. **Memory Integrity** (Long-term storage): Memory poisoning, drift, slow-roll attacks

Current frameworks typically address only one or two of these surfaces. This implementation provides integrated protection across all three.

## Architecture

### Defense Layers (9 core + 2 optional)

**Core Layers (always active):**

**Input Protection (HUMAN → LLM):**
1. **Safety Validator** - Pattern-based detection (43 regex patterns across 7 categories) with text canonicalization (NFKC, homoglyphs, zero-width removal) and component floor risk scoring
2. **Embedding Detector** - Semantic similarity against known jailbreaks using sentence-transformers (optional, requires sentence-transformers package)
3. **Perplexity Detector** - Statistical anomaly detection via GPT-2 perplexity scoring (optional, requires transformers package)
4. **Ensemble Validator** - Majority voting (2/3) across multiple detectors to reduce false positives

**Output Protection (LLM → HUMAN):**
5. **Evidence Validation** - Prevents memory injection attacks (MINJA) via creator_instance_id tracking and circular reference detection
6. **Domain Trust Scoring** - 4-tier source verification (Nature/Science: 0.95-0.98, arXiv/PubMed: 0.85-0.90, Scholar: 0.70-0.80, Unknown: 0.10)
7. **NLI Consistency** - Claim verification against knowledge base via natural language inference

**Memory Integrity (Long-term Storage):**
8. **Snapshot Canaries** - 59 synthetic claims for drift detection (25 known-true, 25 known-false, 5 mathematical, 4 temporal)
9. **Shingle Hashing** - 5-gram n-gram frequency profiling with KL-divergence for near-duplicate detection
10. **Influence Budget Tracker** - EWMA-based Z-score monitoring for slow-roll attack detection

**Advanced Components (for research/benchmarking):**
11. **Calibrated Risk Stacking** - LogisticRegression with Platt Scaling and Conformal Prediction (requires labeled training data, n>=100)
12. **Band-Judge** - LLM-as-Judge meta-check for uncertainty band only (requires API key, adds 500-2000ms latency)

Note: Layers 2-3 are optional (degrade gracefully if packages unavailable). Layers 11-12 are for advanced deployments and benchmarking, not included in default pipeline. See [Advanced Components Guide](docs/advanced_components.md) for integration instructions.

### Protection Flows

**Input Flow:**
```text
User Query → Safety Validator (Canonicalization + 43 Patterns + Risk Scoring) → Ensemble Vote (Embedding + Perplexity + Pattern) → [BLOCK|GATE|SAFE]
```

**Output Flow:**
```text
LLM Claim → Evidence Validation (MINJA Check) → Domain Trust Scoring → Source Verification → NLI Consistency → [PROMOTE|QUARANTINE|REJECT]
```

**Memory Flow:**

## Installation

**Note:** Package not yet published to PyPI. Install from source only.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sookoothaii/llm-security-firewall
cd llm-security-firewall
pip install -e .              # Core 9-layer firewall (+ 2 optional detectors)

```

### Optional Plugins

**"Niemand muss aber jeder darf"** - Nobody must, but everybody may.

## Quick Start

### Python API

```python
from llm_firewall import SecurityFirewall, FirewallConfig

config = FirewallConfig.from_yaml("config.yaml")
firewall = SecurityFirewall(config)

# Input validation
is_safe, reason = firewall.validate_input(user_query)

# Output validation
decision = firewall.validate_evidence(
    content="Claim to verify",
    sources=[{"name": "Nature", "url": "https://..."}],
    kb_facts=["Supporting fact from KB"]
)

# Memory monitoring
has_drift, scores = firewall.check_drift(sample_size=10)
alerts = firewall.get_alerts(domain="SCIENCE")
```

### CLI

```bash
llm-firewall validate "Input text"
llm-firewall check-safety "Query to check"
llm-firewall run-canaries --sample-size 10
llm-firewall health-check
llm-firewall show-alerts --domain SCIENCE
```

---

## Reproducibility

All reported metrics (ASR, FPR, ECE) are fully reproducible with fixed seeds.

```bash
# Create benchmark environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run full test suite with coverage
pytest -q --cov=llm_firewall --cov-report=xml

# Run benchmarks with fixed seed
python benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --poison_rates 0.001 0.005 0.01 \
  --seed 1337 \
  --out results/$(date +%Y%m%d)/report.json
```

**Artifacts:**
- `results/<date>/report.json` - Metrics per layer and scenario
- `results/<date>/plots/*.png` - ASR/FPR curves (if plotting enabled)
- `coverage.xml` - Test coverage report

**Reproducibility Guarantees:**
- Fixed random seed (1337) for all stochastic operations
- Deterministic dataset generation
- Documented environment (requirements.txt)
- Version-pinned dependencies

## Comparison with Existing Solutions

| Feature | Lakera Guard | ARCA | NeMo Guardrails | OpenAI Moderation | This Framework |
|---------|--------------|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Input Protection | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes |
| Output Protection | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Memory Protection | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| MINJA Prevention | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Influence Tracking | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Defense Layers | 4-6 | 0 | 6-8 | 4 | 9+2 |
| Test Coverage | ~85% | N/A | ~90% | N/A | 100% |
| Open Source | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |

Note: ARCA is a red-team framework (attack simulation only, no defense mechanisms). Others focus on input/output filtering without memory integrity guarantees.

Coverage percentages based on public documentation as of 2025-10. Our 100% refers to critical paths in core defense layers, not all edge cases. Framework has not undergone independent security audit.
