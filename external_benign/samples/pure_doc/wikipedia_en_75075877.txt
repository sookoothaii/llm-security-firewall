Critical reception

Sunnyvale of Sputnikmusic described the album as "No matter how beautiful a given moment gets, there remains a sort of ambivalence about the proceedings." Pop music critic Seojeongmingab commented, "His music stands on the side of everyone who experienced and handled the moment by beautifully embodying even the moment of fall." Yoo Seongeun of Music Y reviewed the track 138 of the album and said, "The lyrical melody and soft voice are barely audible, and most of the space is occupied by the lazy stroke sound of the electric guitar, and in the chaotic mind, emotions such as sentimentalness and sadness that you could feel when listening to Radiohead's album in the early days are swirling."
