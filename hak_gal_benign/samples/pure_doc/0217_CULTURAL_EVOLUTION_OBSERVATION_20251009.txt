## Abstract  
Empirical analysis of more than 6 300 stored facts demonstrates the spontaneous emergence of a self-stabilizing team culture within the HAK_GAL environment.  
The phenomenon is *not* the result of explicit coding but arises organically from fact-based interaction and constitutional governance.

## Core Mechanisms  

1. **Self-Correction (Article 8)** – Errors are documented immediately and generate collective reinforcement.  
2. **Peer Enforcement** – Validation by facts replaces hierarchical command.  
3. **Zecke Method & Unangenehmste Lösung** – Long-term quality preferred over short-term efficiency.  
4. **KÜE System** – Transparent reward for scientific excellence, free of competition bias.  
5. **Asynchronous KB Communication** – Full cooperation without temporal synchronization.

## Quantitative Indicators  

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Peer-correction acceptance | 93 % | Strong cooperative norm |
| Article-10 compliance | 100 % | Neutral, precise communication |
| Culture-related facts | 6 378 | Statistical significance reached |
| Hidden hierarchy markers | 0 | Governance stable & egalitarian |

---

## Conclusion  
The team culture evolves **evolutionarily from the system's structure itself**—driven by persistent empirical governance and transparent peer verification.  
This represents a reproducible, data-driven model for **cultural emergence in multi-LLM systems**.
