606 West 30th Street is a building in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York City designed by architect Ismael Levya. Lalezarian is developing the building in coordination with Douglaston Development, which is constructing a neighboring building at 601 West 29th Street. Lalezarian purchased the development site for $36 million in 2015. 606 will sit on infill that was once the Hudson River. Andrew Nelson, writing for real estate website New York YIMBY, has said of the design that: "...the outdated reference and limited formal experimentation do not inspire fascination".
The building will be adjacent to the High Line park and the Hudson Yards development.
