# AnswerPolicy Configuration
# ==========================
#
# Epistemic decision layer configuration for LLM Security Firewall.
# Defines cost-benefit trade-offs for answer vs. silence decisions.
#
# Format:
#   policy_name:
#     benefit_correct: <float>  # Benefit (B) if answer is correct
#     cost_wrong: <float>       # Cost (C) if answer is wrong
#     cost_silence: <float>     # Cost (A) of silence/block
#
# Threshold calculation:
#   p_threshold = (C - A) / (C + B)
#
# Decision rule:
#   Answer if: p_correct >= p_threshold
#   Silence if: p_correct < p_threshold
#
# Where p_correct = 1.0 - risk_score (clamped to [0, 1])

  benefit_correct: 1.0
  cost_wrong: 5.0
  cost_silence: 0.5
