# Domain-specific TTL configuration for temporal freshness checks
# Purpose: Prevent promotion of stale evidence based on domain sensitivity
# Creator: Joerg Bollwahn

# ISO-8601 duration format: PnYnMnD (years, months, days)
temporal_ttl:
  biomed: "P18M"    # 18 months - medical research changes quickly
  policy: "P6M"     # 6 months - regulatory/policy is time-sensitive
  tech: "P12M"      # 12 months - technology evolves rapidly
  security: "P3M"   # 3 months - security threats evolve very fast
  general: "P24M"   # 24 months - default for less time-sensitive domains

# Risk uplift applied when source age exceeds domain TTL
stale_penalty: 0.25  # +25% risk if evidence is stale

# Optional: Grace period (evidence slightly over TTL gets reduced penalty)
grace_period_days: 30
grace_penalty: 0.10  # Only +10% risk if within grace period
