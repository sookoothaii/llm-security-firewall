History
On August 6, 1975, the civil war between UNITA, FNLA and MPLA forced local residents to leave their homes causing a total collapse of infrastructure that lasted over 30 years while the cold war persisted. Most of the residents of Waku Kungo, then Santa Comba, were rescued by the International Red Cross and air-lifted to Portugal. It was the site of a 1994 bombing of a school, resulting in the death of 89 children.
