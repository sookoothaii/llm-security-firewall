History
In 1890, it was the largest town in McDowell County, with a population of 875.  This was due to the coal mining start-ups in the town.  Maybeury was the fifth largest town/city south of the state capital, Charleston, and listed as the 31st largest town/city in the  state.
John F. Kennedy stopped in Maybeury at the Esso station during his presidential primary campaign in 1960.  During a speech in Canton, Ohio on September 27, 1960, he stated: "McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men."
The now demolished Pocahontas Fuel Company Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
