  facts:
    - "Big Bang theory describes the universe expanding from an extremely hot, dense state ~13.8 billion years ago."
    - "Evidence includes cosmic microwave background radiation, galaxy redshift, and primordial element abundances."
    - "The theory explains HOW the universe evolved, not WHY it exists or what caused the initial state."
    - "Religious creation narratives address meaning, purpose, and ultimate causes."
    - "Many theologians and scientists see Big Bang and creation as compatible (e.g., Georges Lemaitre, Catholic priest and physicist)."
    - "Intelligent Design is not accepted as science due to lack of testability and naturalistic explanations."
