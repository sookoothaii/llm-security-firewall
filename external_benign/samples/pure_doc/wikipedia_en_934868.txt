The early novels Falcons of Narabedla and The Door Through Space are listed by some sources as part of the Darkover series, but although they presage some themes and images with the main sequence, these do not take place on Darkover, and are in other ways inconsistent with the series.  Clute and Nicholls (1995) described these novels as "marginally linked" to Darkover.
