Life
After studying English, theater and film at Oberlin College, Bricmont began her career in a New York company that specialized in editing television programs, documentaries and films.  It was the television drama Bernice Bob's Her Hair where she first worked as an assistant editor under Ralph Rosenblum. Just one year later, she was editing Woody Allen's Annie Hall on an equal basis with him. Both Rosenblum and Bricmont received the BAFTA Award for Best Editing for this. Other films were to follow in which Bricmont worked as co-editor before she edited a film independently for the first time in 1983 with Love Letters, a thriller starring Jamie Lee Curtis.
She has worked with Czech director Ivan Reitman for many years since 1990. She not only edited Kindergarten Cop, Junior and One Father Too Many for him, but also Six Days, Seven Nights, Evolution and The Super Ex. She always did this alongside the multiple Oscar-nominated American editor Sheldon Kahn. Bricmont is a member of the American Cinema Editors.
