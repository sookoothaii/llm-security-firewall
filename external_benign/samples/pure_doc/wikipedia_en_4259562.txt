Re-Focus is a 1972 compilation album of songs by the Monkees, released on Bell Records, the successor to Colgems Records, the Monkees' original record label.
The album replaced Colgems' previous three "best-of" collections, Greatest Hits, Golden Hits, and Barrel Full of Monkees.
Re-Focus was repackaged and reissued a number of times in various territories. Each release featured the same track listing but with different packaging and artwork, usually under the title The Best of the Monkees or simply The Monkees (not to be confused with their debut album of the same name). In 1973, Polydor in the Netherlands issued the album as Superstarshine Vol. 29, and in 1979, Arista in Japan issued the album as The Best, with three additional tracks: "Star Collector," "Valleri", and "Words."
In 1976, following Bell Records' renaming to Arista Records, the track listing of Re-Focus was repackaged again for the US as The Monkees Greatest Hits.
