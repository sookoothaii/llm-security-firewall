The 2024 Ohio Valley Conference Women's Basketball Tournament was the final event of the 2023–24 NCAA Division I women's basketball season in the Ohio Valley Conference. The tournament was held March 6–9, 2024 at the Ford Center in Evansville, Indiana. Southern Indiana, a team ineligible for the NCAA Tournament due to being in the second year of a four-year transition from NCAA Division II, won the OVC tournament. The conference's automatic bid to the 2024 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament instead went to Southern Indiana's defeated opponent in the OVC final, UT Martin.


Seeds
Only the top eight teams in the conference qualified for the tournament. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records.
If a team that is not eligible for the NCAA Tournament wins the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament, the conference's automatic bid goes to the tournament runner-up. If that team is also not eligible, i.e. two ineligible teams met in the tournament final, the automatic bid goes to the highest seeded tournament-eligible team.
As Southern Indiana was ineligible for the tournament due to its transition, UT Martin will represent the conference.
