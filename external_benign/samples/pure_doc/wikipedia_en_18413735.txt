Also on the same day he made his debut in a 0–0 draw against Doncaster Rovers. Assistant manager Greg Abbott described Bajner as being an "ideal signing" for Notts County. His signing provoked a stream of messages from Hungary on Notts County's Facebook page, which led to the whole country being blocked from interacting with the page.
