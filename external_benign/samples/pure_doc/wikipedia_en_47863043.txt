The New Ohio Theatre is a performance venue in the West Village of Manhattan in New York City. Located at 154 Christopher Street, the theater was established by Robert Lyons as the SoHo Think Tank in 1994. After losing the lease on his SoHo space for the Ohio Theater in 2010, Lyons moved to the Archive building in the West Village. It is an Off-Off-Broadway theater.
On February 13, 2023, the New Ohio announced that it would close at the end of its season on August 31, 2023. The space would remain a home for non-profit theatre.
Following its closure, the venue was renamed Theatre 154 and placed under the management of Out of the Box Theatrics, a theatre company founded by Elizabeth Flemming. Beginning in late 2023, Out of the Box Theatrics programmed the space as its new artistic home, presenting mainstage productions, cabarets, readings, and community events.
From 2023 to 2026, the venue also served as the New York home for its company-in-residence, Naked Angels, which hosted its long-running cold reading series, Tuesdays@9, at Theatre 154. Both companies are scheduled to relocate to St. Luke's Theatre in 2026.
