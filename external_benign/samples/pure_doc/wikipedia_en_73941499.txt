The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Sava Statistical Region.


Geography
Sušje stands north of the source of Sušjek Creek, northwest of Saint Lawrence's Church in Stranski Vrh.


Name
The name Sušje corresponds to the Slovene common noun sušje 'dry material', which is derived from the adjective suh 'dry'.
