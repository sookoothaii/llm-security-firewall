The Am Cyanide case covers fourteen suspected serial murders by cyanide poisoning in Thailand from 2015 and 2023. It is so-called by the media after the nickname of the accused, Sararat Rangsiwuthaporn (Thai: สรารัตน์ รังสิวุฒาภรณ์), and her modus operandi.
Her poisonings began in 2015, but the case became public attention in April 2023 following the death of Siriporn Khanwong, a friend of Sararat's. Sararat and Siriporn had gone to a river in Ratchaburi province to take part in a Buddhist protection ritual together, after which Siriporn fainted and died on the riverbank.  Following this, Sararat was arrested on 20 April and was denied bail.  In the aftermath, families of previous victims, almost all of whom had personal connections to Sararat but whose deaths had  been ruled to be of natural causes, came forward with their suspicions. The ensuing investigation linked Sararat to fourteen suspected murders, plus one poisoning whose victim survived. The victims were friends and acquaintances whom Sararat either had borrowed money from or killed to steal their possessions. Police said that she was apparently motivated by an online gambling addiction.
The police forwarded over 75 charges against Sararat to the public prosecutor on 30 June. They included premeditated murder, attempted murder, theft causing death, and forgery. The case was instituted on 18 July 2023, with Sararat's ex-husband, Withoon Rangsiwuthaporn, who is a police officer, and her lawyer also accused of helping Sararat conceal evidence. The trial's first taking-of-evidence session took place on 4 July 2024.
In November 2024, Sararat was found guilty of murdering Siriporn Khanwong in the first of 14 trials, and sentenced to death. Meanwhile, her husband was sentenced to 16 months in prison for hiding evidence and helping Sararat evade arrest.
