Joseph Andrew "Grindy" Forrester (July 11, 1877 – November 8, 1932) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player from Barrie, Ontario. He played with the Montreal Shamrocks of the Canadian Hockey Association and the National Hockey Association in 1909–1910. He also played with the Portage Lakes Hockey Club in the IPHL, the Winnipeg Maple Leafs in the MPHL and the Pittsburgh Athletic Club in the WPHL.
Between 1897 and 1902, Forrester played amateur hockey in  Waterloo, Ontario.


Playing style
According to former ice hockey player and coach Jack Adams, Grindy Forrester had one of the hardest shots during his era. When Forrester was about to take the step from amateur to professional hockey prior to the 1905–06 season, leaving Thessalon in Ontario for the Canadian-American IPHL circuit, a newspaper account in the Toronto Star noted him as being a "natural-born hockey player", claiming that "his great wrist-shooting made him the terror of all goal-keepers in the O.H.A.". The paper also pointed out that he was "big, fast, and shifty, and well able to take care of himself."
