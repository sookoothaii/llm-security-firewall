Frans Van Looy  (26 August 1950 – 20 September 2019) was a Belgian cyclist. Looy was professional from 1972 to 1982. He competed in the individual road race at the 1972 Summer Olympics.
After his career as a cyclist, Van Looy worked as a team manager with Team Telekom and T-Mobile until 2006 and had helped run his family's farm in Merksem. However, a local government order ruled that Van Looy could no longer live at the farm, despite a petition signed by 3,000 people to preserve the residence that Van Looy had been born in.
After this order, which ruled his birthplace to be uninhabitable and led to his eviction, he committed suicide in September 2019.
