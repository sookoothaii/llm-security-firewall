The 2020 Malaysian International Classic Race was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 15 February 2020 in Malaysia, starting and finishing in Kuah, the capital of the Langkawi district in the state of Kedah. It was the inaugural edition of the Malaysian International Classic Race and was rated as a 1.1 event as a part of the 2020 UCI Asia Tour. This race was created initially as a one-off race to be a part of the festivities for the 25th anniversary of the Tour de Langkawi; however, organizers have expressed desires to make this race an annual event in the future.
The duo of French rider Johan Le Bon of B&B Hotels–Vital Concept and Australian rider Jesse Ewart of Team Sapura Cycling attacked late in the race and managed to stay in front, with Le Bon emerging victorious in the two-up sprint. French rider Lucas De Rossi of Nippo–Delko–One Provence placed third after winning the reduced bunch sprint behind.
