Peronospora valerianellae is a plant pathogen. It causes downy mildew on leaves of lamb's lettuce Valerianella locusta, which is widely grown as a salad plant in several European countries (for example France and Germany). It is transmitted by seed-borne oospores, and is controlled by fungicide sprays of the foliage.
