In mathematical logic, given an unsatisfiable  Boolean propositional formula in conjunctive normal form, a subset of clauses whose conjunction is still unsatisfiable is called an unsatisfiable core of the original formula.
Many SAT solvers can produce a resolution graph which proves the unsatisfiability of the original problem.  This can be analyzed to produce a smaller unsatisfiable core.
An unsatisfiable core is called  a minimal unsatisfiable core, if every proper subset (allowing removal of any arbitrary clause or clauses) of it is satisfiable.  Thus, such a core is a local minimum, though not necessarily a global one.  There are several practical methods of computing minimal unsatisfiable cores.
A minimum unsatisfiable core contains the smallest number of the original clauses required to still be unsatisfiable.  No practical algorithms for computing the minimum unsatisfiable core are known, and computing a minimum unsatisfiable core of an input formula in conjunctive normal form is
