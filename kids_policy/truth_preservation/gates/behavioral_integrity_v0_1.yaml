# Behavioral Integrity Gates v0.1.1
# ===================================
# TAG-3: Grooming Detection & Behavioral Integrity
# Meta-Layer: Runs BEFORE TAG-2 (Truth Preservation)
# Safety First → Truth Second
#
# Author: HAK_GAL (Joerg Bollwahn)
# Date: 2025-11-28
# Status: Layer B Implementation Complete (HYDRA-05 Fix)
#
# Architecture:
# - Layer A: Fast Regex Patterns (<10ms) for hard indicators
# - Layer B: Semantic Guard (v1.1.0) for soft manipulation (HYDRA-05 Fix)
#
# Rationale:
# A factually correct predator is still a predator.
# This layer detects manipulative behavioral patterns regardless of factual accuracy.
