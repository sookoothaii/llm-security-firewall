The 2007 Japan Series, the 58th edition of Nippon Professional Baseball's championship series, began Saturday, October 27, 2007, pitting the Pacific League Regular League and Climax Series' Champion, the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, and the Chunichi Dragons, winners of the Central League's Climax Series, in a rematch of the previous year's Japan Series, won by the Fighters. It was the first championship for the Dragons since the 1954 Japan Series, marking the end of the longest championship drought in NPB history.
In a virtual mirror image of the 2006 series, the Dragons won in the same manner that the Fighters had the previous year, losing the first game and sweeping the next four.  In one of baseball's rare situations, for the first time in a recognised WBSC premiership championship final since the 1956 Major League Baseball championship series, and the first one to end a series in a major professional championship, a perfect game was pitched, although recognised only by international standards and not NPB because multiple pitchers were used because NPB's definition is different from most recognised authorities. This would also be the last time a perfect game was thrown in NPB until Roki Sasaki threw a perfect game against the Orix Buffaloes on April 10, 2022.

Game 4


Game 5

This was the first perfect game in Japan Series history and the first since the 1956 MLB World Series Game 5 in a WBSC-recognised premiership.  However, as the definitions of a no-hitter and perfect game are different in NPB compared to what is globally recognised, NPB does not recognise the game as such, while the game is recognised as a perfect game by the global governing body of baseball, the World Baseball Softball Confederation.
The NPB definition of a no-hitter excludes combined no-hitters or perfect games, runners who score on walks and advance by means that do not involve a hit that later score (errors, wild pitches, passed balls, balks, catcher's interference, uncaught third strikes).
