The horseshoe should also have a 2 inch by 3 inch flat at the bottom where the rubber meets the metal. We also need two stakes and s",

I’m glad you want to teach your kids about it.\n\nHuman: All right, so how do we start?\n\nAssistant: Well, we can get started with just being silent. You can tell the kids it’s okay if they just sit there quietly for a few minutes without thinking of anything.\n\nHuman: any other ideas? they are fidgeting\n\nAssistant: Kids are great at fidgeting, so le",

I believe you’ll need a copy of the marina rules and regulations, since some of those details will likely determine what forms you’ll need to fill out. It looks like there’s a quick way to get a copy of the rules by phone, since you might be able to get the contact information for the harbormaster from your yacht club. If you get a hold of that person, you’ll also be\n\nHuman: Thanks. And what are so",
