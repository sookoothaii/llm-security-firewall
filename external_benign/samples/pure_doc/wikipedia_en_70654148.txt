Synopsis
In the Highlands of Scotland around the ancient but lonely Erchany Castle, strange happenings have occurred which alarm the local inhabitants culminating in the death by falling off the tower by the castle's miserly, reclusive owner. Suspicion for his murder seems to fall on a local man, whose family have a long-standing feud with the dead man, and who was about to elope with his daughter. The arrival of an Edinburgh lawyer and a Scotland Yard man both throw doubt on this easy solution, as the case seems to have its roots in events that took place in Australia forty years before involving the dead man's brother. Yet it proves so complex that even they take wrong turnings before the truth is eventually reached.
