Alekhin is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the north of the crater Zeeman, and south-southeast of Fizeau. To the west lies Crommelin, and east-southeast is Doerfel.
The rim of Alekhin has been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts to the point where the edge is little more than a curving rise in the surface. The outer wall is completely overlain by the crater pair formed by crater Dawson across the northwest rim and Dawson D on the northern rim. The southern rim is somewhat more heavily marked by gouges and irregularities in the surface, compared to the northeast rim. On the floor are a number of tiny craterlets.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Alekhin.
