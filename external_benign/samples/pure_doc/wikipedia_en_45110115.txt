In the second game of the series, the Bears also won by a score of 8–6, and closed out the series sweep with a 6–0 win in the series finale. Baylor moved into the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper poll at #21 nationally following the Cal Poly sweep. Playing as the #21 team in the country, Baylor went 2–2 over the next week. After a midweek loss to Dallas Baptist in which the Bears pitching surrendered eight walks, the Bears dropped the first game of a three-game weekend series to 2014 NCAA Tournament participant Kent State. On February 21, the Bears swept the Golden Flashes in a doubleheader, winning the two games by a combined score of 10–4.
For the final week of February (and the first day of March), the Bears fell to #25 nationally in the Collegiate Baseball poll and were also ranked number 28 in the NCBWA poll. On February 25, the Bears defeated Northwestern State in a game that had been pushed back one day due to inclement weather. Starter Theron Kay allowed no runs over five innings pitched. On the weekend of February 27, the Bears travelled to Fullerton, California to face Cal State Fullerton, a team that had been ranked in the national polls in the early portion of the season. The Bears were swept over a 3-game series by the Titans, one in which Bears pitching allowed 28 runs.
