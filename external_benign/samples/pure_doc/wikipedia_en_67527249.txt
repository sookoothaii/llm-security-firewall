Albany County for Proper Policing
In 2018, Robbie Ramirez was murdered when Derek Colling, Albany County sheriff's deputy, shot him following a traffic stop. In the wake of Ramirez's death, Karlee Provenza with other members of the Laramie community founded the organization Albany County for Proper Policing (ACOPP).


Trans Day of Visibility 2023
In response to Trans Day of Visibility, Provenza shared a social media post on her private social media account that said, "Auntie Fa Says Protect Trans Folks Against Fascists & Bigots!" The photo imposed with the words contains an older woman holding a scoped black rifle with an external magazine. A screenshot of Provenza's post was shared by the Wyoming Freedom Caucus on Twitter with the caption, "Not even one week after a radical transgender activist slaughtered 6 Christians, including 3 children, a Wyoming Legislator for HD45 shares a disgusting call for further violence. The Wyoming Legislature's House Minority Whip should be ashamed of herself." Provenza has stated that the accusations ascribed to her posts that she supports terrorism and intended to incite violence are false. She has since issued a statement of apology.
In response to Provenza's support of the Second Amendment in protection of trans people, the Wyoming Republican Party Chairman Frank Eathorne filed a formal complaint against Provenza, asking that the Speaker of the House, Albert Sommers, remove Provenza from her committee assignments. Speaker Sommers made a formal statement in his decision to dismiss the complaints filed against Provenza and she remains on the committees she was originally assigned to.
