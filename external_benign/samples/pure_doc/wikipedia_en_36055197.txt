In linear programming, a discipline within applied mathematics, a basic solution is any solution of a linear programming problem satisfying certain specified technical conditions.
For a polyhedron



        P


    {\displaystyle P}

 and a vector





            x


            ∗


        ∈


            R


            n




    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{*}\in \mathbb {R} ^{n}}

,





            x


            ∗




    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{*}}

 is a basic solution if:

All the equality constraints defining



        P


    {\displaystyle P}

 are active at





            x


            ∗




    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} ^{*}}


Of all the constraints that are active at that vector, at least



        n


    {\displaystyle n}

 of them must be linearly independent. Note that this also means that at least



        n


    {\displaystyle n}

 constraints must be active at that vector.
A constraint is active for a particular solution




          x



    {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }

 if it is satisfied at equality for that solution.
A basic solution that satisfies all the constraints defining



        P


    {\displaystyle P}

 (or, in other words, one that lies within



        P


    {\displaystyle P}

) is called a basic feasible solution.
