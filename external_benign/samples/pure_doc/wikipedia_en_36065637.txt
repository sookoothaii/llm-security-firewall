The Colfax Carnegie Library, also known as Colfax Public Library, is a historic Carnegie library located at Colfax, Indiana.  It was built in 1917, and is a 1+1⁄2-story, Classical Revival style brick building on a raised basement.  It features a red terra cotta style hipped roof and decorative frieze.  It was built in part with $9,000 provided by the Carnegie Foundation.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The historic Carnegie library remains in operation today as a public library; its name has been changed to "Colfax-Perry Township Public Library" to accurately represent its wider service area.
