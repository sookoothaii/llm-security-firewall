The Alliance for Change (AFC) is a liberal political party in Guyana.


History
The party was established in 2005 by three MPs who left other parties;  Raphael Trotman of the People's National Congress, Khemraj Ramjattan of the People's Progressive Party and Sheila Holder of the Working People's Alliance. Trotman became the leader of the party.
In the 2006 elections, the party received 8.1% of the vote, winning six seats. Their vote share increased to 10.3% in the 2011 elections, which saw the party win seven seats.
Prior to the 2015 elections, the AFC formed a joint electoral list with the A Partnership for National Unity alliance. The combined list won 33 seats, allowing PNC/APNU leader David A. Granger to become president.
During the 2023 Guayana Esequiba crisis and increased tensions with Venezuela, Alliance For Change called for a ban on Venezuelans with Guyanese citizenship from voting in elections, as well as not granting citizenship to more people from the neighboring country.
