Six teams from the East Asia-Pacific Region competed in a round-robin stage, followed by ranking finals. Japan defeated the Cook Islands in a close final held at Club Hippique in Port Vila, Vanuatu. Both finalists qualified for the 2006 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy; the other four teams -- Tonga, Vanuatu, Indonesia and Samoa -- had their World Cup hopes dashed six years before the final competition.
