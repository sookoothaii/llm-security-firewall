The G-Dragon Media Exhibition: Übermensch commonly shortened to Übermensch Exhibition is a travelling immersive media art exhibition created and conceptualized by South Korean singer-songwriter and artist G-Dragon to accompany and expand on the themes of his 2025 studio album Übermensch. The project blends large-scale multimedia installations, video art, original set and costume designs, and interactive exhibits to present the visual world and artistic process behind the album.


Background
G-Dragon agency Galaxy Corporation and a team of creative partners developed the exhibition as a complementary artistic programme to the Übermensch album and world tour. The exhibition frames the album’s concepts—identity, transformation and artistic authorship through a sequence of immersive rooms that combine original artworks, archival materials and specially produced media content. The organizers have positioned the exhibition as a means for visitors to “step into” the artist’s creative universe beyond a conventional concert experience.


Format and content
The Übermensch exhibition is presented as a walkthrough gallery of themed spaces. Typical features reported by press include large projection pieces, multi-screen video installations, sculptural objects and interactive digital elements tied to the album’s songs and visual motifs. Media coverage emphasized the exhibition’s use of cutting-edge production and media technologies to create an immersive experience rather than a traditional static art show. Organizers have also offered official merchandise and limited edition collaborative products at many stops.


Tour and locations
The exhibition has toured multiple major Asian cities during 2025 booking windows, with confirmed pop-up and mall-based venues as well as arena adjacent spaces.
An early run of the exhibition was reported in March 2025, presented as a limited engagement that ran through March 19. in Hong Kong, a Harbour City pop-up in August 2025, occupying exhibition space in the Ocean Centre and Gateway Arcade. In Macau, a stop listed by the Macao Government Tourism Office and local partners. In Osaka and other Japanese and Southeast Asian stops were announced as part of the exhibition’s regional expansion, official channels and local press released dates and ticketing information for those pop-ups. In Singapore at Jewel Changi Airport pop-up in early October 2025 was promoted on social platforms and lifestyle outlets.


Production and collaborators
Public materials credit G-Dragon as the exhibition’s creative lead alongside Galaxy Corporation and several creative-technology partners and local promoters who handled production and regional distribution. Press reports note that the project combined the artist’s creative direction with specialised media-production teams to translate stage and album visuals into a gallery format.


Reception
Press coverage described the exhibition as a successful extension of G-Dragon’s brand as both musician and multimedia artist, highlighting fan enthusiasm and strong attendance at several pop-up stops. Reviewers emphasized the show’s high production values and its appeal to fans seeking a more intimate and contemplative access point to the Übermensch era beyond concerts. Some lifestyle outlets framed the exhibition as part of a broader trend of popstar-led immersive art experiences.


Records and attendance
The Exhibition achieved notable commercial and attendance records across its various cities in Asia following its launch in early 2025.
In Seoul, the exhibition recorded more than 55,000 visitors during its initial ten-day run at The Hyundai Seoul, marking one of the largest attendance figures for a pop-artist-led media exhibition in South Korea. The exhibition’s Media Tech Zone, which included VR, AR, and hologram installations, sold out within minutes of ticket release, while the Merchandise Zone reached full reservation capacity in under one hour.
In Taipei, tickets for the exhibition held inside Taipei 101 sold out in approximately 20 minutes, with all daily passes distributed within the first hour of general sale. Taiwanese media described the event as a major cultural phenomenon, with the exhibition maintaining full attendance throughout its month-long run.
The Tokyo edition of the exhibition reportedly attracted over 10,000 visitors on its opening day alone, held at Shinjuku Triangle Square, and was noted for drawing visitors “of all ages and demographics.”
Subsequent pop-up versions in Hong Kong and Macau also recorded strong turnouts. The Hong Kong exhibition, staged at Harbour City in August 2025, received a 4.3 / 5 user rating from more than 400 verified visitors on ticketing site Klook, with fans praising its immersive displays and interactive installations.
The series of exhibitions became one of the most attended pop-culture gallery projects of 2025 in Asia, noted by industry media for its integration of immersive art and K-pop fandom culture.
