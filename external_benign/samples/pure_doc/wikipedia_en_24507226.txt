New Writings in SF 13 is an anthology of science fiction short stories edited by John Carnell, the thirteenth volume in a series of thirty, of which he edited the first twenty-one. It was first published in hardcover by Dennis Dobson in 1968, followed by a paperback edition under the slightly variant title of New Writings in SF 13 by Corgi the same year.
The book collects eight novelettes and short stories by various science fiction authors, with a foreword by Carnell. The fourth, fifth and eighth stories were later reprinted in the American edition of New Writings in SF 9.
