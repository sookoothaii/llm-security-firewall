It was started on January 19, 2011 as a game abstraction library built over GWT and was previously named Forplay. As of January 2024, its current version is 2.0.8.


History
Forplay was created in January 2011. In August 2011, the project was forked and rebranded as PlayN.


Name
The name PlayN comes from the project's motto "Cross platform game library for N>=5 platforms", as it claims to build games for five platforms: Java SE, HTML 5, Flash, Android and iOS.
