NGC 3125 is an irregular dwarf starburst galaxy in the constellation Antlia that was discovered by John Herschel in 1835. It is located approximately 38 million light-years away from Earth. Starburst galaxies are galaxies in which unusually high numbers of new stars are forming, springing to life within intensely hot clouds of gas.


Morphology
In a 2006 study, the two giant H II regions in the galaxy were confirmed to each host two young star clusters. The brightest cluster, NGC 3125-A1 is a confirmed super star cluster with 170,000 solar masses that likely contains some of the most massive stars every found.


Nearby galaxies
NGC 3125 is member of the LGG 189 Group, which also includes the galaxies NGC 3113, NGC 3137, and NGC 3175.
