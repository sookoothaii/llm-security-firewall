Road to the final

The 2019 season was a 15-team competition, consisting of three geographical conferences. Each conference leader at the end of the regular season, the Crusaders from New Zealand, Jaguares from Argentina and Brumbies from Australia gained home berths in the quarterfinals, as did the top-ranked wildcard team, the Hurricanes from New Zealand's conference. Their four wildcard opponents in the quarterfinals were the next best teams as ranked at the end of the regular season.
In the quarter-finals the Crusaders beat fellow New Zealand team the Highlanders while the Jaguares beat the Chiefs. For the semi-finals it was the Crusaders defeating the Hurricanes in Christchurch and the Jaguares defeating the Brumbies in Buenos Aires. Because of being the higher placed team in the regular season log standings, the final was held in Christchurch.
