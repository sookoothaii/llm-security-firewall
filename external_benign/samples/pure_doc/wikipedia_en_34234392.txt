Synopsis
A renowned Chinese medicine practitioner Cheung Si-Sung passed on his Chinese medicine shop to his son Wai-On after his wife died. Wai-On did not take good care of the shop and it lost its customers. Si-Sung’s grandson Yee-Fai works for a large Chinese medicine company. His enthusiasm attracts his colleague Sin-Yu, who does not want to work under her rich father. Yee-Fai is very careful with Sin-Yu as he thinks that she has been appointed to investigate him. Yee-Fai goes to Shanghai on business, and while there, he looks for an old friend of Si-Sung’s. Sin-Yu goes along with him as his secretary, and volunteers to help him fulfil his grandfather’s wish. Later, Yee-Fai meets Chinese medicine practitioner Geung Sum-Yu and Gook Yut-Siu. As Yee-Fai gets to know Yut-Siu better, they eventually work together in the medicine business.
