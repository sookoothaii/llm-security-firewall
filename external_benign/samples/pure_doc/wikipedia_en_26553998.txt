Show overview
The programme consists of four homeowners each preparing their houses in their own unique style to impress the other three contestants, who rate the interior design, homeliness, comfort, and hospitality all in a bid to win £1,000. The show is often compared with other daytime shows Come Dine with Me and House Gift.


Adaptation
An adaptation of this show was Mein Zuhause, Dein Zuhause – Wer wohnt am schönsten? on kabel eins in Germany in 2013.
The American version of the show is called May the Best House Win USA and it airs it on TLC.


Criticism
The show has been criticized for being too much like Channel 4's Come Dine with Me, mainly in Harry Hill's TV Burp. Sian Brewis on Leicester Mercury described May The Best House Win as a Come Dine With Me, for houses.  Lorraine Gibson of the Bournemouth Echo also noted the similarity predicting that the show would, like Come Dine With Me, eventually be transferred to the evening schedules.  UKGameshows.com said "It's not such a bad programme really, but the likeness to Come Dine with Me is hard to ignore, and makes the programme feel quite derivative".
