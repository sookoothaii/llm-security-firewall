Plot
Linda Murri, the daughter of a liberal wealthy family, was raised under lenient sexual mores, and now is suffocating in a marriage to a conservative doctor. Her brother, an intense young man who wastes his time on whores and gambling, can no longer watch his sister suffer. He plots the murder of her husband, and through the crime lays bare a society feeding on unspeakable passions and illicit actions.
