Group B of UEFA Euro 1996 was one of four groups in the final tournament's initial group stage. It began on 9 June and was completed on 18 June. The group consisted of France, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania.
France won the group and advanced to the quarter-finals, along with Spain. Bulgaria and Romania failed to advance.
On the second matchday, on 13 June, the match between Bulgaria and Romania featured a ghost goal by Dorinel Munteanu: in the first half, with Romania already 1–0 down to an early Hristo Stoichkov goal, Munteanu's shot hit the crossbar, crossed the goal line by about a foot, after which it bounced back. Referee Peter Mikkelsen and his assistants did not notice and the goal was not awarded.
