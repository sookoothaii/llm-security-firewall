Oregon Ballot Measure 117, the Ranked-Choice Voting for Federal and State Elections Measure, was a proposed Oregon state initiative that was decided by voters as part of the 2024 Oregon elections on November 5, 2024. If approved, primary and general elections for statewide and federal offices would have been done through ranked-choice (instant-runoff) voting, as opposed to the current plurality voting system, starting in 2028. It would also have made the office of the secretary of state provide voter education on how to use the system.


Background
Other states that have adopted similar measures are Maine and Alaska. Two Oregon counties have already adopted RCV for local elections, being Benton and Multnomah.
