Oakland Plantation is a historic plantation house located near Fort Motte, Calhoun County, South Carolina. It was built about 1800, and is a 1+1⁄2-story clapboard house with two flanking wings set back from the façade. The house sits on a brick foundation and has an enclosed basement. It has a front porch, supported by six square columns. Oakland is still surrounded by farmland, and the house and one outbuilding, the original kitchen, are situated on a one-acre lot.
It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.
