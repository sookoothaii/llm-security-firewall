On 31 July 1581 the cathedral chapter of the Cathedral of Trier elected Johann von Schönenberg to be the new Archbishop of Trier.  Pope Gregory XIII confirmed his appointment on 26 January 1582.  He was consecrated as a bishop by Ludovico Madruzzo on 12 August 1582. As archbishop, Johann von Schönenberg presided over the Trier witch trials.
Shortly before his death, Lothar von Metternich became his coadjutor archbishop.  He died in Koblenz on 1 May 1599.  He is buried in the Cathedral of Trier.  In 1602, Hans Ruprecht Hoffmann completed a grave-altar at von Schönenberg's tomb.
