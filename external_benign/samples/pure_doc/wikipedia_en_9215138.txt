Fading Out is the Primitive Radio Gods' first and only officially released EP. It doubles as an extended single for the song of the same name from the White Hot Peach album. Aside from the title track, the EP contains two songs from Mellotron On! that did not make the cut for White Hot Peach, a remix of "Fading Out", and a new track called "Rope".

Trivia
The song "Rope" would later be re-recorded by former member Jeff Sparks' band Duplex on their 2003 album Hot Looks for Summer, which also included re-recorded versions of PRG songs "Agent of Deliverance" and "Becky Brown" from the eMusic-released Sing Monkey Sing demo tape.
